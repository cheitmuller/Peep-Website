          "answer": "Open Peep and tap the '+' button to log your current mood. Choose an emoji that represents how you're feeling, add optional tags and notes if you'd like, then tap save. It's that simple!"

          "answer": "Peep uses a range of emojis to help you express your emotions. You can choose from happy, sad, angry, anxious, calm, excited, and many more. Pick whichever emoji best captures how you're feeling in the moment - there's no right or wrong choice."

Tags help you categorize your moods (like 'work', 'exercise', 'family'), while notes let you add context about what happened or how you felt. Both are optional but can be helpful for tracking patterns."
