		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Next.js project structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project setup into subtasks for initial project creation, folder structure setup, and configuration of dependencies and deployment settings.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard Next.js project initialization with a well-defined folder structure and dependencies. The complexity is relatively low as it follows established patterns and documentation. However, it's foundational for the entire project, so it warrants breaking into subtasks for proper organization. The task requires basic Next.js knowledge but doesn't involve complex customizations or integrations."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement brand assets and styling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the brand styling implementation into subtasks for global CSS setup, typography configuration, and brand asset integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires setting up the visual foundation of the site with brand colors, typography, and assets. While not technically complex, it requires attention to detail and consistency across the application. The task involves CSS configuration, font setup, and asset management. Breaking it into subtasks will help ensure all brand elements are properly implemented and consistent throughout the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create responsive layout structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the responsive layout implementation into subtasks for the overall grid system, responsive breakpoints configuration, and specific component layout structures.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a responsive layout requires careful planning and implementation of CSS Grid/Flexbox with appropriate breakpoints. This task has moderate complexity as it forms the structural foundation of the site and must work across multiple device sizes. The implementation details include creating reusable layout components and ensuring proper responsiveness, which requires testing across various viewport sizes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement header with logo and download button",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the header implementation into subtasks for the component structure and styling, and the download button functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a relatively simple header component with a logo and CTA button. The complexity is low to moderate as it requires implementing the component, styling it according to brand guidelines, and ensuring it works responsively. The implementation is straightforward with clear requirements and example code provided."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement left side hero content",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the hero content implementation into subtasks for the text content component and the CTA button styling and functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a component with headline, subheadline, and CTA button. The complexity is relatively low as it's primarily focused on text content and styling. The implementation details are clear with example code provided. The main considerations are ensuring proper typography, spacing, and responsive behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement right side hero content with video",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the video implementation into subtasks for the video component with autoplay functionality, the iPhone mockup frame styling, and responsive behavior across devices.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the video implementation with autoplay functionality, IntersectionObserver for visibility detection, and the styling of an iPhone mockup frame. It requires JavaScript for video control and careful CSS for the mockup styling. The implementation needs to handle browser autoplay restrictions and ensure proper responsive behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement optional footer",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement the footer component with copyright information and privacy policy link, including styling and dynamic year generation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a simple component with minimal functionality - just displaying copyright information and a privacy policy link. The complexity is very low as it involves basic JSX, minimal styling, and a simple dynamic year calculation. The implementation details are straightforward with clear example code provided."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement analytics and tracking",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the analytics implementation into subtasks for Vercel Analytics setup, custom event tracking for App Store clicks, and time on page/bounce rate tracking configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating analytics to track specific metrics. The complexity is moderate as it requires setting up Vercel Analytics, implementing custom event tracking, and ensuring proper data collection. It requires understanding of analytics concepts and JavaScript event handling. Testing the analytics implementation also adds complexity as it requires verification that events are being properly tracked."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement animations and interactions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the animations implementation into subtasks for entrance animations using Framer Motion, hover/interactive animations for buttons and elements, and accessibility considerations for reduced motion preferences.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing subtle animations using Framer Motion and CSS transitions. The complexity is moderate as it involves working with an animation library, creating consistent animations across components, and ensuring they respect user preferences for reduced motion. The implementation requires attention to detail to ensure animations enhance rather than detract from the user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize performance and deploy to Vercel",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the optimization and deployment process into subtasks for image/video optimization, SEO implementation, accessibility improvements, and the Vercel deployment process.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it encompasses multiple areas: performance optimization, accessibility, SEO, and deployment. It requires optimizing assets, implementing SEO best practices, ensuring accessibility standards, and configuring the deployment process. The task also involves testing across multiple dimensions (performance, accessibility, etc.) and requires knowledge of various web optimization techniques and deployment configurations."
