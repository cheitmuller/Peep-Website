Peep – Marketing Website PRD
Version 1.0 — Minimal Landing Page
1. Overview
The Peep website is a single, simple landing page designed to communicate what the app does in one glance and drive iOS downloads. The site should feel light, friendly, minimal, and consistent with the Peep brand (white space, black lines, bird mascot, soft tone).
Primary Goal: Convert visitors → iOS app downloads.
Secondary Goals: Explain Peep in one sentence and show the app UI through a video.
2. Inspiration
The website should structurally mimic the hero section of: https://www.amyfoodjournal.com/
Specifically:

Left: headline + subheadline + download button
Right: phone mockup or video
Simple fixed header
Clean white background
Minimal sections (only one hero section)

3. Page Structure
Header (Top Bar)

Left: Peep logo (bird icon + Peep wordmark if desired)
Right: "Download on iOS" button

Style: rounded pill, Peep purple (#6E4AFF), white text, Apple icon
Clicking it opens App Store link.



Header should be:

Fixed or static (either is fine; simple is preferred)
Minimal height
White background

4. Hero Section
Layout: Two columns

Left: Text + CTA
Right: Video of the app inside a phone mockup frame

Left Side Content

"A simpler way to feel better." (Your provided line — this is the main hero headline.)
Subheadline
